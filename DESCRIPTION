Description: A set of tools to perform simulations based on considerations of 
    Grinnellian ecological niches and other user defined dispersal parmaters.
    Dispersal simulations can be performed under constant or changing 
    environmental conditions (distinct scenraios of suitability). The main
    results that can be obtained using these simulations include accessible 
    areas and colonized areas.
