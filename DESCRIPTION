Description: A set of tools to perform simulations based on considerations of 
    Grinnellian ecological niches and other user defined dispersal parmaters.
    Dispersal simulations can be performed under constant or changing 
    environmental conditions (distinct scenraios of suitability). The main
    results that can be obtained using these simulations include accessible 
    areas and colonized areas. Considerations of accessible areas are 
    particularly novel in the tools included here compared to similar packages.
    Theoretical and methodological bases for the approaches and tools 
    implemented can be found in:
